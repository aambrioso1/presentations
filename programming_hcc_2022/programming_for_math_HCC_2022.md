# Programming for Mathematics Teachers

### Description
The ability to write code is a powerful tool.   This skill deserves some attention from teachers in general and mathematics teachers in particular.   Python is a good language for this purpose.   It is both easy to learn and widely used in all fields of study.  In my presentation, I will first show the rudiments of programming in Python.   Then I will present code examples with nice connections to our Calculus curriculum:  

##### Topics
* Introduction to Python
* The average value function and Pi (MAC 2311)
* Graphs of tangent lines and parametric equations (MAC 2312) 
* 2D and 3D plots and animations (MAC 2311)   
* matrices, vectors, and rotations (MAC 2313) 
* functions of several variables, partial derivatives, and gradients for a Neural Network (MAC 2313)


### Introduction to Python
(a) Description
(b) Some ways to run a Python program
(i) Install Python on your system from Python.org and use a text editor
(ii) Install Anaconda
(iii) Open an account with PythonAnywhere.com
(iv)  Install the PyCharm IDE
(v)  Install Visual Studio Code and the Python extension

### Language basics
* print
* data types including f strings
* Conditionals
* Loops
* functions

* import
** Standard Libraries
** third party libraries

### The Average Value Function
Derive formula for computing the integral based on the average value functions
Apply to the formula to the computation of Pi using an integral

### 2D and 3D plots, parametric equtions, tangent lines, and animations


### Matrices, Vectors, and Rotations
