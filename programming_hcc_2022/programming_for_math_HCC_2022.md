# Programming for Mathematics Teachers

### Description
The ability to write code is a powerful tool.   This skill deserves some attention from teachers in general and mathematics teachers in particular.   Python is a good language for this purpose.   It is both easy to learn and widely used in all fields of study.  In my presentation, I will first show the rudiments of programming in Python.   Then I will present code examples with nice connections to our Calculus curriculum:
