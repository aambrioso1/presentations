# Programming for Mathematics Teachers

#### Description
The ability to write code is a powerful tool.   This skill deserves some attention from teachers in general and mathematics teachers in particular.   Python is a good language for this purpose.   It is both easy to learn and widely used in all fields of study.  In my presentation, I will first show the rudiments of programming in Python.   Then I will present code examples with nice connections to our Calculus curriculum:  

Goals
*  Advocate for the importance of open source resources to society.
*  Show that coding can be a useful tool for a mathematics teacher.
*  Give at least one example a teacher who can code could use in a Calculus class.
*  Advocate for the for the importance of coding to society
*  Give teachers some knowledge of Python they can share with students.
*  Give teachers some modern examples of how mathematics (vectors and calculus) are used (specifically for machine learning) 

#### Topics
* Introduction to Python
* The average value function and Pi (MAC 2311)
* Graphs of tangent lines and parametric equations (MAC 2312) 
* 2D and 3D plots and animations (MAC 2311)   
* matrices, vectors, and rotations (MAC 2313) 
* functions of several variables, partial derivatives, and gradients for a Neural Network (MAC 2313)


#### Introduction to Python
* Description
* Some ways to run a Python program
    * Install Python on your system from Python.org and use a text editor
    * Install Anaconda
    * Open an account with PythonAnywhere.com
    * Install the PyCharm IDE
    * Install Visual Studio Code and the Python extension

#### Language Basics
* print
* data types including f-strings
* exponentiation
* conditionals
* loops
* functions
* import
    * standard libraries
    * third party libraries

#### The Average Value Function
Derive formula for computing the integral based on the average value functions
Apply to the formula to the computation of Pi using an integral

#### 2D and 3D plots, parametric equations, tangent lines, and animations

#### Matrices, Vectors, and Rotations

#### Partial Derivatives and Neural Networks
