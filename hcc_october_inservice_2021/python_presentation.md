Abstract

Open-source programming

As part of my sabbatical leave application I proposed to "prepare a presentation with examples of how Python could be used by undergraduate educators and students to enhance general education."  We live in a unique time in which the ability to program is accessible to everyone.  Open source programming languages, and their associated communities, can enhance work in any occupation or field of study.   They give users more control, through code, over technology and information.   The Python programming language is ideal for this purpose.  It is powerful and easy to learn.   It has a large open-source community that provides support for work in every academic discipline.    Researchers in fields as diverse as natural language processing and oceanography are using Python and its libraries to support their work.   I will present examples that show how Python code might be used to enhance undergraduate teaching in English, Humanities, Music, Earth Science, and Mathematics.
