# October Inservice 2021 Presentation

Abstract

As part of my sabbatical leave application I proposed to "prepare a presentation with examples of how Python could be used by undergraduate educators and students to enhance general education."  We live in a unique time in which the ability to program is accessible to everyone.  Open source programming languages, and their associated communities, can enhance work in any occupation or field of study.   They give users more control, through code, over technology and information.   The Python programming language is ideal for this purpose.  It is powerful and easy to learn.   It has a large open-source community that provides support for work in every academic discipline.    Researchers in fields as diverse as natural language processing and oceanography are using Python and its libraries to support their work.   I will present examples that show how Python code might be used to enhance undergraduate teaching in English, Humanities, Music, Earth Science, and Mathematics.

I.  Introduction

(A)  Advanced use of Python in various disciplines

(B)  Advantages of Programming
* Absolute control of technology
* Leverage the global stock of open source effort
* If you really want to learn something write code for it.

II. Some coding ideas for Educators
* Math and Science:  Numerical Analysis (Signorini)
* File management and web-scraping:  
* Science - NOAA Data 
* Language/Linguistics (Zipf's Law)
* English/Humanities: (Natural Language Toolkit) 
* Music - Mingus Library

III.  The Future of Technology
